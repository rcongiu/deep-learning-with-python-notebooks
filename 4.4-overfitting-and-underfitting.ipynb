    "problem. Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning.\n",

    "The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization. \"Optimization\" refers to the process of \n",

    "course, but you do not control generalization; you can only adjust the model based on its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower your loss on training data, the lower your loss on \n",
    "test data. While this is happening, your model is said to be _under-fit_: there is still progress to be made; the network hasn't yet \n",

    "that are specific to the training data but that are misleading or irrelevant when it comes to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent a model from learning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the training data, _the best solution is of course to get \n",
    "more training data_. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that is no longer possible, the next best solution \n",
    "is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on what information it is allowed to \n",
    "store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most \n",
    "prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n",

    "will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any \n",
    "generalization power. For instance, a model with 500,000 binary parameters could easily be made to learn the class of every digits in the \n",
    "MNIST training set: we would only need 10 binary parameters for each of the 50,000 digits. Such a model would be useless for classifying \n",
    "new digit samples. Always keep this in mind: deep learning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, but the real challenge \n",
